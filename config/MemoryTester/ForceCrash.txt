InfoHeader=The game will not start due to insufficient memory, the current memory allocation is [AllocatedMemory]MB.
InfoLine1=Minimum: 2500MB/2.5GB - You can play, but I would set the distance down to 4.
InfoLine2=Recommended: 3500MB/3.5GB - You can play, but set it higher if turning up distance past 12.
InfoFooter=Install 64bit java, then go into Technic Launcher options under Java Settings to set the amount.
